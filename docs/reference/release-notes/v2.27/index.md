[Previous release notes](../v2.26/index.md)

### Queries on Demand

When developing a Gatsby site there's no need to run all graphql queries before serving the site.
Instead, Gatsby could run queries for pages as they're requested by a browser.
This would avoid having to wait for slower queries (like image processing) if you're editing an unrelated part of a site.

This feature is available under a flag.

```sh
cross-env GATSBY_EXPERIMENTAL_QUERY_ON_DEMAND=1 gatsby develop
```

Please try it and [let us know](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/27620) if you have any issues
(it may become a default for `develop` in the future)

[Details and discussion](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/27620).

## Work in progress

### Experimental: Lazy images in develop

We've got some feedback that the more image-heavy your website gets, the slower `gatsby develop`.
This experimental version of `gatsby-plugin-sharp` only does image processing when the page gets requested.

Try early alpha (and [let us know](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/discussions/27603) if you have any issues with it):

```
npm install gatsby-plugin-sharp@lazy-images
```

Lazy images are enabled by-default in this version.

### Documentation Reorganization

Weâ€™ve heard repeatedly from the community that Gatsby is a powerful tool,
but it has a steep learning curve. We want to make it easier to get started with Gatsby.
And that means having documentation that helps yâ€™all find the information you need when you need it.
